Snapshot is a signalling tool that allows governance participants to signal for free.

As gas fees are here to stay on the Ethereum blockchain, Curve governance is now using a tool called Snapshot to allow governance users to signal their preferences on Curve proposals.

Whilst this tool doesn't replace governance and will only be used to signal, it's a great way for holders of all sizes to make their voices heard as **voting is completely free.**

## **Voting**

Head over to the signalling tool: [https://signal.curve.fi/#/curve](https://signal.curve.fi/#/curve) and connect your Metamask wallet. It should be the one where you hold your veCRV (vote locked CRV).

Simply review your proposal, select your preferred option and click Vote:

You will be prompted by Metamask to sign a transaction which is completely free and your voting vote will be counted according to your voting weight at the moment of the proposal creation.
