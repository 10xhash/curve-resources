LP Tokens represent a composition of all coins within a liquidity pool. They can be obtained by depositing one or more assets into a pool. When holding a LP Token, the user is exposed to all assets within the pool, no matter which coins he deposited.

The UI provides diverse charts regarding the pool. The "Chart" tab shows a chart of the LP Tokken price with regard to - in this example - USDT. 
On the top right, there is the possibility to expand and refresh the chart or adjust its timeframe.

Besides a chart for prices, the UI also provides an overview on swaps and liquidity actions of the pool on the "Pool Activity" tab.
