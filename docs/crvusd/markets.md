# Markets

On the Markets page you can view all the available collateral types.

The page shows the current [borrow rate](/crvusd/understanding-tokenomics#borrow-rate), total amount of $crvUSD borrowed, and total amount of collateral backing it.

If you do not have a position, you can click on any market to [create a loan](/crvusd/loan-creation).

If you already have a position it will show a dollar sign overlay on the left, and clicking on the market will take you to a page to [manage your loan](/crvusd/loan-details).

## Collateral Choices

While testing $crvUSD, the team created a market for $sfrxETH with a small market cap ($10MM) because it had a compatible oracle. Additional forms of collateral are expected to be approved by the DAO.
