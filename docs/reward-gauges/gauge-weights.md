# Gauge Weights

## What are gauge weights?

Simply put, a gauge weight translates into how much of the daily CRV inflation it receives.

For example on the below chart, the Y pool is currently receiving around 72% of the daily CRV inflation. This means that all liquidity providers in the Y pool share 72% of the daily CRV.

## Why are gauge weights so important?

Because those weights decide where the CRV inflation goes, it allows the DAO to control where most of the liquidity should go and balance liquidity. It's a powerful tool for voters that must be used responsibly.

The gauge weight is updated once a week on Thursdays.

## Who can vote for gauge weights?
