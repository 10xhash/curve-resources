# Creating a Pool Gauge

## Deploy a Gauge

You can deploy the gauge directly through the UI simply by posting the address: [https://classic.curve.fi/factory/create\_gauge](https://classic.curve.fi/factory/create_gauge)

## Submit a DAO Vote

Once you've created your gauge, you need to submit it to the DAO for a vote. [https://classic.curve.fi/factory/create\_vote](https://classic.curve.fi/factory/create_vote)â€‹

The address that submits must have 2500 veCRV in order to create a vote.

Once the gauge has been submitted, politics take over. You may want to visit the governance forum and explain why your pool should be made eligible for rewards.
