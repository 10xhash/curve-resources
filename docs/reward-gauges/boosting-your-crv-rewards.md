This guide is assuming you have already provided liquidity and that you are currently staking your LP tokens on the DAO gauge.

One of the main incentive for CRV is the ability to boost your rewards on provided liquidity. Vote locking CRV allows you to acquire voting power to participate in the DAO and earn a boost of up to 2.5x on the liquidity you are providing on Curve.

## **Figuring out your required boost**

The first step to getting your rewards boosted is to figure out how much CRV you'll need to lock. All gauges have different requirements meaning some pools are easier to boost than others. It depends on how much others have locked and how much the liquidity gauge has.

You can find the calculator at this address: [https://dao.curve.fi/minter/calc](https://dao.curve.fi/minter/calc)​

## **Locking your CRV**

Once you know how much and how long you wish to lock for, visit the following page: [https://dao.curve.fi/locker](https://dao.curve.fi/locker)​

Enter the amount you want to lock and select your expiry. Remember locking is not reversible. The amount of veCRV received will depend on how much and how long you vote for.

You can extend a lock and add CRV to it at any point but you cannot have CRV with different expiry dates.

After creating your lock, you will need to apply your boost.

## **Applying your boost**

Head over to the minter page: [https://dao.curve.fi/minter/gauges](https://dao.curve.fi/minter/gauges)​

If you see your new boost after Current boost: then you do not need to do anything else.

If your current boost hasn't moved, you will need to claim CRV from each of the gauge you're providing liquidity in to update your boost. After doing so, your boost should be showing.

*Your boost will not be updated until you withdraw, deposit or claim from a liquidity gauge.*

### *Boost Info*
The list of pools and boost/reward info has moved away from the minter page. You can now find all this information on each pool page, on the classic.curve.fi site.

Alternatively, this information can also be found in the new UI ([curve.fi](https://curve.fi/)) under the "Your Details" section on the pool page. Be aware: The new UI does not display future boost yet.

## **Formula**

The boost mechanism will calculate your **earning weight** by taking the smaller amount of two values. The first value is simple, it's the amount of liquidity you are providing which in this example is $10,000. This amount is your maximum earning weight.
